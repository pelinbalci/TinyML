The hardware is made up of 3 fundamental building
blocks: 

- the compute, 
- the memory, 
- the storage.


The compute is the brain.  It's effectively where you do the processing.

The memory is where you temporarily store data.  It's like a short-term memory.

And your storage is your permanent hard disk. When you take the power off, it still remembers your data.


A microprocessor is a much bigger piece of computing engine,
versus a microcontroller, the thing that we were talking
about in the previous video, of which there over 250 billion of them
out in the world.

So you have to buy the microprocessor.  And then you put all the other components together.
That's how you build a traditional desktop, for instance.

Microcontoller is already integrated: the processor, the memory and storage. 

An embedded system is typically designed to perform one task. 


In a laptop you have a base operating system like windows, macos or linux, or in a mobiele device you have android or ios.You can
build your applications on top of os and each app has different capabilities, one can take photo other plays music, another make phone calls...

But in embedded system you don't need an operating system. But building efficient system is critical, there are too much specialization.

Embedded hardware is limited in performance, power consumption ans storage

Embedded software is not portable and flexible as mainstream computing
